SUBMISSION CONTENTS:
    README.txt      *this document
    File_System.py  *Python source code for File System utility

EXECUTION:
    RUNNING:
        To run the utility program, enter the following command in a python-equipped shell environment:
        
        > python3.6 File_System.py <fat32.img>

        For the program to run, <fat32.img> must be a path to a valid .img file containing a FAT32 file system image.

    COMMANDS:
        Upon startup, the file system's present working directory (PWD) is set to the system's root directory.
        Once the program is running, the following commands are available for execution:
            
            > info                                        *outputs information inherent to the file system image
            > stat <FILE_NAME/DIR_NAME>                   *outputs size, attributes, and starting cluster of requested file/directory
            > size <FILE_NAME>                            *outputs size of requested file
            > cd <DIR_NAME>                               *changes PWD to requested directory
            > read <FILE_NAME> <POSITION> <NUM_BYTES>     *reads requested number of bytes from requested file starting at requested position
            > volume                                      *outputs volume name for file system image
            > mkdir <SUBDIR_NAME>                         *creates requested sub-directory in PWD
            > rmdir <SUBDIR_NAME>                         *deletes requested sub-directory in PWD
            > quit                                        *quits utility program

        Note: command functionality is dependent on PWD and its contents.

CHALLENGES:
    Thankfully, the Python library has a robust set of helper API for dealing with thornier sub-tasks such as endian-interpretation, encoding and
    decryption, and byte reading/writing. The most difficult aspect of this assignment for us was carefully reading the Microsoft FAT specification
    document and accurately integrating its conventions into our implementation of FAT32 File System Utility.
